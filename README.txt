This is a custom heatmap script


you call it with: plot_heatmap(data, filename)

"data" which in our data set is multiple rows of Fiber-photometry recordings that are 20 seconds long
"filename" a string variable which will become the Title of the heatmap plot

Try it first with the example variables in the file :)

This script also plots a verticle line in the center on the figure as we are plotting transitions where the middle is the transition point
